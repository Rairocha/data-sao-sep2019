It is currently moving out of the laboratory and into real-world applications for health care and medicine. <a href=\"http://www.112capital.com/perspectives\">Many startups</a> are using modern data and AI technologies to tackle problems related to workflow optimization and automation, demand forecasting, treatment and care, diagnostics, drug discovery, personalized medicine, and many other areas. Some of these companies are beginning to speak publicly about their AI initiatives; our upcoming Artificial Intelligence conferences in San Jose and London have a strong roster of speakers who will describe applications of <a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ca/public/schedule/stopic/3332\">AI in health and medicine</a>.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>AI’s transition to the real world can be challenging. This article highlights new projects and tools that can alleviate and address these challenges. We’re not trying to be comprehensive; our goal is to raise awareness of some of the bottlenecks that workers in health care and medicine will face as they adopt AI. We will focus on recent progress in foundational topics that the health care and medical communities care about: access to high-quality labeled data, developing ML models that cut across organizations, and data markets and networks.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>AI’s footprint in health care</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>While it’s important to distinguish reality from hype (and there is a lot of hype), we see many companies making significant investments in health care. According to a 2019 World Intellectual Patent Office (WIPO) <a href=\"https://www.wipo.int/publications/en/details.jsp?id=4386\">report</a>, \"Life and Medical Sciences\" is the third-highest field for patent applications (the top two are \"Telecommunications\" and \"Transportation\"), with roughly 40,000 patent applications:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<figure id=\"id-RlWiz\"><img alt=\"Number of patent families for application field categories\" class=\"iimageswipo-application-fieldpng\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/WIPO-Application-Field-26d735842bd9b61b48d93b4dd8648dc5.png\">\\r\\n<figcaption><span class=\"label\">Figure 1. </span>A <a href=\"https://www.wipo.int/publications/en/details.jsp?id=4386\">2019 WIPO Study</a> shows the number of patent families by application field. A patent may refer to more than one category or subcategory. Image by Ben Lorica.</figcaption>\\r\\n</figure>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>This focus on AI is important for several reasons. First, in most countries (and in <a href=\"https://news.aamc.org/press-releases/article/workforce_report_shortage_04112018/\">many parts of the US</a>), there is a shortage of doctors. Using AI to make a first pass at <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2193361-ai-can-diagnose-childhood-illnesses-better-than-some-doctors/\">diagnostics</a> can reduce the workload on medical staff, who are already overburdened. Second, there’s a lot of evidence that machine learning (ML) can augment medical professionals, including <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30325645\">radiologists</a>. Third, interest in continual health monitoring, using consumer devices like the Apple Watch, is exploding, but don’t expect a doctor or a nurse to be monitoring your data feed. If you’re about to have a heart attack or a stroke, it will be AI that analyzes the data, notes the abnormality, and generates the alarm. In health care, as in other industries, AI is the only way to scale services to match demand.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Data quality and labeling</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Since the first days of the Strata Data Conference, we’ve been saying that most of the work in data isn’t playing with fancy algorithms; the hard part is acquiring high-quality data, cleaning it so that it’s usable, and labeling it. In a <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/the-quest-for-high-quality-data\">recent post</a>, Ihab Ilyas and Ben Lorica described some of the challenges faced by companies that need to assemble and maintain high-quality data.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The saying goes, “Garbage in, garbage out,” but making sure the data coming into your algorithm isn’t garbage is a big job. As DJ Patil and Hilary Mason write in <em><a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/data-driven/9781491925454/ch01.html\">Data Driven</a></em>, “Cleaning the data is often the most taxing part of data science, and is frequently 80% of the work.” In his <a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/artificial-intelligence-conference/9781492050544/9781492050544-video324795\">keynote</a> at O’Reilly’s AI Conference in New York in 2019, Christopher Ré noted that we’ve developed tools that make it easier to build models, we’re developing better tools for deploying AI, and more and more data sets suitable for training are becoming publicly available. We’re getting a lot better at automating the “hard” parts of developing AI, and that automation is an important part of democratization. But Ré pointed out that cleaning and labeling data hasn’t been democratized. It’s still a task that requires a lot of human time and expertise.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Medical data comes in many forms: images, audio, unstructured text, and occasionally even structured data. Regardless of the form, the problems that affect medical data aren’t fundamentally different from the problems in other industries: missing data, corrupt values, suspicious outliers, typographic errors, lack of labels, and more. It’s common for data from different silos to be contradictory. Deciding what to do with that data is difficult: a leading data scientist once told us about a cancer data set in which the strongest correlation for a cancer diagnosis was the location where the image was taken. The problem turned out to be the scanners; the scanners at every radiology facility were calibrated differently. What would it take to correct a data set like this? Data sets for training algorithms are large and can’t be edited manually. Tens of thousands, if not millions, of samples used to train deep learning algorithms are more than any human can handle.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>While it doesn’t solve all the problems of data cleaning, <a href=\"http://www.holoclean.io/\">Holoclean</a> is a big step forward. It is an open source, machine-learning-based system for automatic error detection and repair. Holoclean has been deployed by multiple financial services and the census bureaus of several countries. Researchers have also used Holoclean on data sets related to <a href=\"https://holoclean.github.io/gh-pages/files/misc/detection.pdf\">health care</a> (<a href=\"https://holoclean.github.io/gh-pages/files/misc/detection.pdf\">a hospital data set</a> used in data cleaning benchmarks) and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.00820\">public health</a> (a food inspection data set).</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>As more and more medical databases become available, labeling the data to train machine learning models becomes ever more critical. This is true for repositories comprised of medical imaging data, genomics, and other data types. Labeled data has typically been created “by hand”: humans inspect and classify each data item in the set. Data is often labeled when it is created (for example, medical images labeled with a patient ID and a diagnosis); services like Mechanical Turk are often used to classify unlabeled data. Neither approach is adequate. Mechanical Turk is only useful for classifications that don’t require expertise (labeling dogs and cats is fine, finding tumors isn’t), while labels added when the image is created may not be useful in a different context. For example, you might want to use chest X-rays to train an application for detecting broken ribs, in which case labels about lung tumors or pneumonia would be irrelevant. GE has claimed that most medical data <a href=\"http://newsroom.gehealthcare.com/beyond-imaging-ai-imaging-innovation/\">never gets analyzed</a>—but this data still may be useful for training if it can be properly tagged.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In addition to Holoclean, Christopher Ré and his collaborators have released an open source <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07723\">data programming</a> tool called <a href=\"http://snorkel.org\">Snorkel</a>. Snorkel automates the work of creating training data sets by labeling data programmatically, and then uses machine learning to classify and even transform images.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>It’s no surprise that some of the recent applications of Snorkel have been in the life and medical sciences. In <a href=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/339630v3\">a recent project, the creators of Snorkel</a> took a population-scale biomedical repository (the UK Biobank) to build a weakly supervised deep learning model for classifying rare aortic valve malformations using unlabeled cardiac MRI sequences. By using data programming, they were able to automate labeling for roughly 4,000 previously unlabeled MRI sequences, and avoid labeling the sequences by hand.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>These early use cases for data programming should inspire others to unlock their own data. The lack of labeled data is also fueling parallel efforts in the area of algorithms. The rise in tools for data programming occurs at a time when other researchers are exploring <em>“</em>small sample learning<em>”</em> (machine learning tools that rely on smaller amounts of labeled data) <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.00473\">for biomedical image analysis</a>.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Besides labeling data for use in machine learning, data programming can be used to extract knowledge and information buried within existing data sources. Snorkel has been used to create training data for a machine reading system that automatically collects and synthesizes genetic associations and makes them available in a structured database. Another product of Ré’s lab, <a href=\"http://gwaskb.stanford.edu/\">GwasKB</a>, is an information extraction system that combs through biomedical literature to extract associations between traits and genomic variants discovered in genome-wide association studies (GWAS).</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Overcoming silos with \"coopetitive learning\"</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>It’s common for data to be stuck in silos. That problem plagues many kinds of applications: medical, financial, industrial, corporate boundaries, and so on. Sometimes there are good reasons for the silos: privacy, security, and regulatory compliance are a few reasons that come to mind. But often, there isn’t any good reason not to share data. And regardless of the reason, data that is siloed in different organizations, or different groups within the same organization, almost always leads to suboptimal analytic products and services. In medicine, privacy regulations make it difficult to combine data sets from different organizations. But patients have long, complex medical histories, and frequently see many specialists, even for one problem. A comprehensive view of patients’ medical histories yields more accurate models and applications. Similarly, think about financial institutions that are trying to build fraud models. Each company has a portion of any given individual’s activities, but to build a good model for fraud, having all the financial activity in one data set would be a huge help.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>At <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/ai-and-systems-at-riselab\">O’Reilly’s Artificial Intelligence Conference in Beijing</a>, Ion Stoica, director of <a href=\"https://rise.cs.berkeley.edu/\">UC Berkeley’s RISELab</a>, <a href=\"https://ai.oreilly.com.cn/ai-cn/public/schedule/detail/76617?locale=en\">described new projects</a> that allowed organizations to cooperate without actually sharing data as \"coopetitive learning.\" <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coopetition\">Coopetition</a> means cooperation between competitors who are all hoping to derive mutual benefits. Coopetitive learning allows participants to build models based on a virtual data set that’s larger and richer than anything they could assemble on their own. Coopetitive learning also applies when multiple organizations have sensitive data they cannot share, but that cooperate to compute a global model (based on collective data) that is better than their individual or local models.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Two technologies can be used to implement coopetitive learning:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>Cryptography and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_multi-party_computation\">secure multi-party computation</a>.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>The use of trusted hardware (including specialized hardware <a href=\"https://software.intel.com/en-us/sgx\">enclaves</a>).</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>RISELab currently has a few projects that fit under coopetitive learning. <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/ai-and-systems-at-riselab\">Helen</a> is a coopetitive learning platform for linear regression; it uses cryptography to allow multiple partners to build a combined model without sharing the data. RISELab also has an early project for coopetitive analytics that would be appropriate for business intelligence applications.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/how-to-build-analytic-products-in-an-age-when-data-privacy-has-become-critical\">Federated learning</a> is a related approach to achieving the same goal. In federated learning, cooperating systems build models from their own data, and a subset of users send model-related information to a central site to be combined; the combined model is then sent back to the individual systems. More precisely, no data is shared, only ephemeral, model-related updates from a random set of users. Federated learning is already in <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/2019/06/03/how-federated-learning-could-shape-the-future-of-ai-in-a-privacy-obsessed-world/\">production</a> on Android phones, where it’s used <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5othcNmync&amp;t=9s\">in conjunction with differential privacy</a>, to build predictive models for what words a user is typing. Intel is working on using <a href=\"https://www.intel.ai/federated-learning-for-medical-imaging/\">federated learning for medical imaging</a>. This project allows institutions to build shared models without sharing the images themselves. For this application, the size of the image collections is probably as important as patient privacy. Open source tools such as <a href=\"https://www.tensorflow.org/federated\">TensorFlow Federated</a> now make it possible for companies to begin experimenting with federated learning.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>While coopetitive learning and federated learning are similar in concept, they have significantly different use cases, and thus they rely on different algorithms and techniques. As the Android application implies, federated learning is most useful when there are many participants—literally millions. It would be useful for health care applications that run on the Apple Watch, for instance. Coopetitive learning is a better match for sharing data between a smaller number of institutions with larger data sets.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Data networks and economics</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Given the demand for data and new tools for working with data at scale, we should expect new ways to cooperate to arise. <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/data-collection-and-data-markets-in-the-age-of-privacy-and-machine-learning\">Markets for exchanging data</a> are forming, as are networks for sharing and trading data.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.computable.io\">Computable Labs</a> is a startup that is building tools to create data markets; the white paper \"<a href=\"https://github.com/computablelabs/computable/blob/master/whitepaper/computable_whitepaper.pdf\">Fair value and decentralized governance of data</a>\" describes what these markets might look like and how they would work. It addresses issues like the value of data in a market, governance of the market, and protocols for recording provenance and ensuring privacy. A market for data might allow participants, ranging from individuals to institutions, to exchange their data—possibly for money, possibly for other goods and services.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>RISELab’s Michael Jordan and his collaborators take the idea of data markets a step further by envisioning <a href=\"https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/2imtstfu\">new kinds of two-sided markets</a>. These markets are mediated on both sides by artificial intelligence, forming new kinds of intelligent systems that incorporate networks of humans and machines:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<blockquote>Consider the fact that precious few of us are directly connected to the humans who make the music we listen to (or listen to the music that we make), to the humans who write the text that we read (or read the text that we write), or to the humans who create the clothes that we wear (or wear the clothes we create). Making those connections in the context of a new engineering discipline that builds market mechanisms on top of data flows would create new \"intelligent markets\" that currently do not exist.</blockquote>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Imagine that you’re a diabetic and using a service that recommends recipes based on your medical condition. But you’re also a picky eater and don’t like a lot of the dishes the service recommends. However, you have your own service that can signal to others what you would like to eat. In Jordan’s two-sided market, your recommendation engine would talk to the other engine and negotiate a menu that’s satisfactory to both sides.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Jordan has initiated a new program to research such two-sided markets. This program draws from computer science, statistics, and economics. He discussed some recent results in this new “microeconomics meets machine learning” research program <a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ca/public/schedule/detail/77921\">at the Artificial Intelligence Conference in San Jose</a>.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Changing cultures</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>AI will certainly have a big impact on everything in health care: diagnosis, research, personal medicine, and even logistics. But taking advantage of AI requires some cultural and organizational changes.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>We’ve already seen some of these changes in other disciplines, such as finance. People want decisions to be <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_explanation\">explainable</a>, and in some cases, these explanations are legally mandated. If you’re denied a loan, you want to know why. The same is true of medical decisions: people want to understand the rationale behind any course of treatment. Explainability is only partly a research problem; while progress has been made on explainability, there is still a long way to go. The problem is also cultural: doctors (even more than bankers) have long expected patients to take their word. Medical culture has begun to change, but the change still isn’t complete.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Medical practitioners, along with patients, will also have to develop a culture that allows an AI system to participate as an assistant. Will patients be able to give their medical histories to a computer, without fearing that their privacy will be abused (as it has with social media)? ProjectsByIf, a design consultancy, has compiled a list of design patterns <a href=\"https://catalogue.projectsbyif.com/\">for responsible data sharing</a>. Will doctors be able to <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/the-working-relationship-between-ais-and-humans-isnt-master-slave\">collaborate with AI systems</a> in making diagnoses? This is also a cultural shift that requires research into user interfaces and user experience. We are too accustomed to seeing AI systems as oracles that produce answers, not as participants in a discussion.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>We will all benefit as medical practitioners implement AI systems: for diagnosis, for treatment planning and intervention, for drug discovery, and much more. As they do so, practitioners will face issues that are common in every industry: collecting and cleaning data, building networks that enable appropriate data sharing, preserving privacy, explaining decisions, and more. These are all exciting research areas for AI developers. But more than that, making progress in these areas requires cultural change: rethinking how we interact with each other, in addition to our intelligent assistants.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Related</strong>:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/lessons-learned-building-natural-language-processing-systems-in-health-care\">“Lessons learned building natural language processing systems in health care”</a></li>\\r\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/managing-machine-learning-in-the-enterprise-lessons-from-banking-and-health-care\">“Managing machine learning in the enterprise: Lessons from banking and health care”</a></li>\\r\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/the-quest-for-high-quality-data\">“The quest for high-quality data”</a></li>\\r\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/acquiring-and-sharing-high-quality-data\">“Acquiring and sharing high-quality data”</a></li>\\r\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/how-ai-and-machine-learning-are-improving-customer-experience\">“How AI and machine learning are improving customer experience”</a></li>\\r\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/got-speech-these-guidelines-will-help-you-get-started-building-voice-applications\">“Got speech?

It is currently moving out of the laboratory and into real-world applications for health care and medicine. <a href=\"http://www.112capital.com/perspectives\">Many startups</a> are using modern data and AI technologies to tackle problems related to workflow optimization and automation, demand forecasting, treatment and care, diagnostics, drug discovery, personalized medicine, and many other areas. Some of these companies are beginning to speak publicly about their AI initiatives; our upcoming Artificial Intelligence conferences in San Jose and London have a strong roster of speakers who will describe applications of <a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ca/public/schedule/stopic/3332\">AI in health and medicine</a>.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>AI’s transition to the real world can be challenging. This article highlights new projects and tools that can alleviate and address these challenges. We’re not trying to be comprehensive; our goal is to raise awareness of some of the bottlenecks that workers in health care and medicine will face as they adopt AI. We will focus on recent progress in foundational topics that the health care and medical communities care about: access to high-quality labeled data, developing ML models that cut across organizations, and data markets and networks.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>AI’s footprint in health care</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>While it’s important to distinguish reality from hype (and there is a lot of hype), we see many companies making significant investments in health care. According to a 2019 World Intellectual Patent Office (WIPO) <a href=\"https://www.wipo.int/publications/en/details.jsp?id=4386\">report</a>, \"Life and Medical Sciences\" is the third-highest field for patent applications (the top two are \"Telecommunications\" and \"Transportation\"), with roughly 40,000 patent applications:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<figure id=\"id-RlWiz\"><img alt=\"Number of patent families for application field categories\" class=\"iimageswipo-application-fieldpng\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/WIPO-Application-Field-26d735842bd9b61b48d93b4dd8648dc5.png\">\\r\\n<figcaption><span class=\"label\">Figure 1. </span>A <a href=\"https://www.wipo.int/publications/en/details.jsp?id=4386\">2019 WIPO Study</a> shows the number of patent families by application field. A patent may refer to more than one category or subcategory. Image by Ben Lorica.</figcaption>\\r\\n</figure>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>This focus on AI is important for several reasons. First, in most countries (and in <a href=\"https://news.aamc.org/press-releases/article/workforce_report_shortage_04112018/\">many parts of the US</a>), there is a shortage of doctors. Using AI to make a first pass at <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2193361-ai-can-diagnose-childhood-illnesses-better-than-some-doctors/\">diagnostics</a> can reduce the workload on medical staff, who are already overburdened. Second, there’s a lot of evidence that machine learning (ML) can augment medical professionals, including <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30325645\">radiologists</a>. Third, interest in continual health monitoring, using consumer devices like the Apple Watch, is exploding, but don’t expect a doctor or a nurse to be monitoring your data feed. If you’re about to have a heart attack or a stroke, it will be AI that analyzes the data, notes the abnormality, and generates the alarm. In health care, as in other industries, AI is the only way to scale services to match demand.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Data quality and labeling</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Since the first days of the Strata Data Conference, we’ve been saying that most of the work in data isn’t playing with fancy algorithms; the hard part is acquiring high-quality data, cleaning it so that it’s usable, and labeling it.

Coopetitive learning also applies when multiple organizations have sensitive data they cannot share, but that cooperate to compute a global model (based on collective data) that is better than their individual or local models.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Two technologies can be used to implement coopetitive learning:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>Cryptography and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_multi-party_computation\">secure multi-party computation</a>.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>The use of trusted hardware (including specialized hardware <a href=\"https://software.intel.com/en-us/sgx\">enclaves</a>).</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>RISELab currently has a few projects that fit under coopetitive learning. <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/ai-and-systems-at-riselab\">Helen</a> is a coopetitive learning platform for linear regression; it uses cryptography to allow multiple partners to build a combined model without sharing the data. RISELab also has an early project for coopetitive analytics that would be appropriate for business intelligence applications.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/how-to-build-analytic-products-in-an-age-when-data-privacy-has-become-critical\">Federated learning</a> is a related approach to achieving the same goal. In federated learning, cooperating systems build models from their own data, and a subset of users send model-related information to a central site to be combined; the combined model is then sent back to the individual systems. More precisely, no data is shared, only ephemeral, model-related updates from a random set of users. Federated learning is already in <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/2019/06/03/how-federated-learning-could-shape-the-future-of-ai-in-a-privacy-obsessed-world/\">production</a> on Android phones, where it’s used <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5othcNmync&amp;t=9s\">in conjunction with differential privacy</a>, to build predictive models for what words a user is typing. Intel is working on using <a href=\"https://www.intel.ai/federated-learning-for-medical-imaging/\">federated learning for medical imaging</a>. This project allows institutions to build shared models without sharing the images themselves. For this application, the size of the image collections is probably as important as patient privacy. Open source tools such as <a href=\"https://www.tensorflow.org/federated\">TensorFlow Federated</a> now make it possible for companies to begin experimenting with federated learning.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>While coopetitive learning and federated learning are similar in concept, they have significantly different use cases, and thus they rely on different algorithms and techniques. As the Android application implies, federated learning is most useful when there are many participants—literally millions. It would be useful for health care applications that run on the Apple Watch, for instance. Coopetitive learning is a better match for sharing data between a smaller number of institutions with larger data sets.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Data networks and economics</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Given the demand for data and new tools for working with data at scale, we should expect new ways to cooperate to arise. <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/data-collection-and-data-markets-in-the-age-of-privacy-and-machine-learning\">Markets for exchanging data</a> are forming, as are networks for sharing and trading data.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.computable.io\">Computable Labs</a> is a startup that is building tools to create data markets; the white paper \"<a href=\"https://github.com/computablelabs/computable/blob/master/whitepaper/computable_whitepaper.pdf\">Fair value and decentralized governance of data</a>\" describes what these markets might look like and how they would work. It addresses issues like the value of data in a market, governance of the market, and protocols for recording provenance and ensuring privacy. A market for data might allow participants, ranging from individuals to institutions, to exchange their data—possibly for money, possibly for other goods and services.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>RISELab’s Michael Jordan and his collaborators take the idea of data markets a step further by envisioning <a href=\"https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/2imtstfu\">new kinds of two-sided markets</a>. These markets are mediated on both sides by artificial intelligence, forming new kinds of intelligent systems that incorporate networks of humans and machines:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<blockquote>Consider the fact that precious few of us are directly connected to the humans who make the music we listen to (or listen to the music that we make), to the humans who write the text that we read (or read the text that we write), or to the humans who create the clothes that we wear (or wear the clothes we create). Making those connections in the context of a new engineering discipline that builds market mechanisms on top of data flows would create new \"intelligent markets\" that currently do not exist.</blockquote>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Imagine that you’re a diabetic and using a service that recommends recipes based on your medical condition. But you’re also a picky eater and don’t like a lot of the dishes the service recommends. However, you have your own service that can signal to others what you would like to eat. In Jordan’s two-sided market, your recommendation engine would talk to the other engine and negotiate a menu that’s satisfactory to both sides.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Jordan has initiated a new program to research such two-sided markets. This program draws from computer science, statistics, and economics. He discussed some recent results in this new “microeconomics meets machine learning” research program <a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ca/public/schedule/detail/77921\">at the Artificial Intelligence Conference in San Jose</a>.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Changing cultures</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>AI will certainly have a big impact on everything in health care: diagnosis, research, personal medicine, and even logistics. But taking advantage of AI requires some cultural and organizational changes.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>We’ve already seen some of these changes in other disciplines, such as finance. People want decisions to be <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_explanation\">explainable</a>, and in some cases, these explanations are legally mandated. If you’re denied a loan, you want to know why. The same is true of medical decisions: people want to understand the rationale behind any course of treatment. Explainability is only partly a research problem; while progress has been made on explainability, there is still a long way to go. The problem is also cultural: doctors (even more than bankers) have long expected patients to take their word. Medical culture has begun to change, but the change still isn’t complete.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Medical practitioners, along with patients, will also have to develop a culture that allows an AI system to participate as an assistant. Will patients be able to give their medical histories to a computer, without fearing that their privacy will be abused (as it has with social media)? ProjectsByIf, a design consultancy, has compiled a list of design patterns <a href=\"https://catalogue.projectsbyif.com/\">for responsible data sharing</a>. Will doctors be able to <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/the-working-relationship-between-ais-and-humans-isnt-master-slave\">collaborate with AI systems</a> in making diagnoses? This is also a cultural shift that requires research into user interfaces and user experience. We are too accustomed to seeing AI systems as oracles that produce answers, not as participants in a discussion.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>We will all benefit as medical practitioners implement AI systems: for diagnosis, for treatment planning and intervention, for drug discovery, and much more. As they do so, practitioners will face issues that are common in every industry: collecting and cleaning data, building networks that enable appropriate data sharing, preserving privacy, explaining decisions, and more. These are all exciting research areas for AI developers. But more than that, making progress in these areas requires cultural change: rethinking how we interact with each other, in addition to our intelligent assistants.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Related</strong>:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/lessons-learned-building-natural-language-processing-systems-in-health-care\">“Lessons learned building natural language processing systems in health care”</a></li>\\r\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/managing-machine-learning-in-the-enterprise-lessons-from-banking-and-health-care\">“Managing machine learning in the enterprise: Lessons from banking and health care”</a></li>\\r\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/the-quest-for-high-quality-data\">“The quest for high-quality data”</a></li>\\r\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/acquiring-and-sharing-high-quality-data\">“Acquiring and sharing high-quality data”</a></li>\\r\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/how-ai-and-machine-learning-are-improving-customer-experience\">“How AI and machine learning are improving customer experience”</a></li>\\r\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/got-speech-these-guidelines-will-help-you-get-started-building-voice-applications\">“Got speech?

The good news is that critical components for data management, processing, transport, and orchestration continue to improve and automation technologies <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/what-machine-learning-means-for-software-development\">should ease operational burdens</a> moving forward.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Related</strong>:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>Jesse Anderson: <a href=\"https://www.jesse-anderson.com/2019/05/reducing-operational-overhead-with-pulsar-functions/\">\"Reducing Operational Overhead with Pulsar Functions\"</a>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/one-simple-chart-who-is-interested-in-spark-nlp\">“One simple chart: Who is interested in Spark NLP?”</a></li>\\r\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/one-simple-graphic-researchers-love-pytorch-and-tensorflow\">“One simple graphic: Researchers love PyTorch and TensorFlow”</a></li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Tyler Akidau: <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/the-world-beyond-batch-streaming-101\">Streaming 101</a> and <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/the-world-beyond-batch-streaming-102\">Streaming 102</a>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/apache-kafka-and-the-four-challenges-of-production-machine-learning-systems\">“Apache Kafka and the four challenges of production machine learning systems”</a></li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Jay Kreps: <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/building-apache-kafka-from-scratch\">“Building Apache Kafka from scratch”</a>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Karthik Ramasamy: <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/architecting-and-building-end-to-end-streaming-applications\">“Architecting and building end-to-end streaming applications”</a>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/what-machine-learning-means-for-software-development\">“What machine learning means for software development”</a></li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<p>Continue reading <a href=\\'https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/one-simple-chart-who-is-interested-in-apache-pulsar\\'>One simple chart: Who is interested in Apache Pulsar?.</a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/XpvLu3evTxk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>',\n",

Companies have to maintain compatibility with the instruction set, King explains, and there are a whole set of compatibility requirements, which we presume are precisely as stringent as Arm and are needed to maintain runtime compatibility should many Power chips be developed, as IBM hopes will happen.</i>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n<p>Continue reading <a href=\\'https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/four-short-links-22-august-2019\\'>Four short links: 22 August 2019.</a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/5-Gb5WIWMDs\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>',\n",

Yesterday, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/congress-puts-big-tech-in-crosshairs-11563311754\">a US subcommittee on antitrust</a> grilled representatives from Amazon, Google, Facebook, and Apple in Congress, and presidential candidates have gone so far as to suggest that <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/08/politics/elizabeth-warren-amazon-google-facebook/index.html\">these behemoths should be broken up</a>. In the European Union, regulation is already happening: in March, the EU levied its <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/20/business/google-fine-advertising.html\">third multibillion-dollar fine against Google</a>for anti-competitive behavior.</p>\\r\\n<p>In <a href=\"https://blog.aboutamazon.com/company-news/2018-letter-to-shareholders\">his 2018 letter to shareholders</a>, published this past April, Jeff Bezos was already prepping for conversations with regulators. He doesn’t think Amazon is a monopoly. Instead, the company’s founder argues it is “just a small player in global retail.”</p>\\r\\n<p>In Bezos’s defense, for many of the products Amazon sells, there are indeed many alternative sources, suggesting plenty of competition. Despite Amazon’s leadership in online retail, <a href=\"https://mgmresearch.com/amazon-vs-walmart-revenues-and-profits-comparison-1999-2018/\">Walmart is more than double Amazon’s size </a>as a general retailer, with Costco not far behind Amazon. Specialty retailers like Walgreens and CVS in the pharmacy world and Kroger and Albertson’s in groceries also dwarf Amazon’s presence in their categories.</p>\\r\\n<p>But Amazon does not just compete with Walmart, CVS, Kroger, and other retailers—it also competes with the merchants who sell products through its platform.</p>\\r\\n<p>This competition isn’t just the obvious kind, such as the Amazon Basics-branded batteries that by 2016 represented <a href=\"https://www.1010data.com/company/blog/market-insights-series-amazon-s-advance-the-battle-of-batteries/\">one third of all online battery sales</a>, as well as similar Amazon products in audio, home electronics, baby wipes, bed sheets, and kitchenware. Amazon also competes with its merchants for visibility on its platform, and charges them additional fees for favored placement. And because Amazon is now leading with featured products rather than those its customers think are the best, its merchants are incentivized to advertise on the platform. Amazon’s fast-growing advertising business is thus a kind of tax on its merchants.</p>\\r\\n<p>Likewise, Google does not just compete with other search engines like Bing and DuckDuckGo, but with everyone who produces content on the world wide web. Apple’s iPhone and Google’s Android don’t just compete with each other as smartphone platforms, but also with the app vendors who rely on smartphones to sell their products.</p>\\r\\n<p>This kind of competition is taken for granted by antitrust regulators, who are generally more concerned with the end cost for consumers. And as anyone who has shopped online will know, Amazon is nearly always the cheaper option. (In fact, surveys have suggested that between <a href=\"https://marketingland.com/online-shoppers-use-amazon-to-compare-products-259139\">seven</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2016/09/27/amazon-is-the-first-place-most-online-shoppers-visit.html\">nine</a> out of 10 Americans will check Amazon to compare the price of a purchase.) As long as the monopoly doesn’t lead to us forking out more money, then antitrust regulators traditionally leave it alone.</p>\\r\\n<p>However, this view of antitrust leaves out some unique characteristics of digital platforms and marketplaces. These giants don’t just compete on the basis of product quality and price—they control the market through the algorithms and design features that decide which products users will see and be able to choose from. And these choices are not always in consumers’ best interests.</p>\\r\\n<h2>A fresh approach to antitrust</h2>\\r\\n<p>All of the internet giants—Amazon, Google, Facebook, and insofar as app stores are considered, Apple—provide the illusion of free markets, in which billions of consumers choose among millions of suppliers’ offerings, which compete on the basis of price, quality, and availability.</p>\\r\\n<p>But if you recognize that what consumers really choose from is not the universe of all possible products, but those that are offered up to them either on the homepage or the search screen, the “shelf space” provided by these platforms is in fact far more limited than the tiniest of local markets—and what is placed on that shelf is uniquely under the control of the platform owner. And with mobile playing a larger and larger role, that digital shelf space is visibly shrinking rather than growing.</p>\\r\\n<p>In short, the designers of marketplace-platform algorithms and screen layouts can arbitrarily allocate value to whom they choose. The marketplace is designed and controlled by its owners, and that design shapes “<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Who-Gets-What-Why-Matchmaking/dp/0544705289\">who gets what and why</a>” (to use the marvelous phrase from Alvin E. Roth, who received a Nobel prize in economics for his foundational work in the field of market design.)</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>When it comes to antitrust, the question of market power must be answered by analyzing the effect of these marketplace designs on both buyers and sellers, and how they change over time. How much of the value goes to the platform, how much to consumers, and how much to suppliers?</p>\\r\\n<p>The platforms have the power to take advantage of either side of their marketplace. Any abuse of market power is likely to show up first on the supply side. A dominant platform can squeeze its suppliers while continuing to pass along part of the benefit to consumers—but keeping more and more of it for themselves.</p>\\r\\n<p>Over time, though, consumers feel the bite. Power over sellers ultimately translates into power over customers as well. As the platform owner favors its own offerings over those of its suppliers, choice is reduced, though it is only in the endgame that consumer pricing—the typical measure of a monopoly—begins to be affected.</p>\\r\\n<p>The control that the platforms have over placement and visibility puts them in a unique position to collect what economists call <em>rents</em>: that is, value extracted through the ownership of a limited resource. These rents may come in the form of additional advantage given to the marketplace’s own private-label products, but also through the fees that are paid by merchants who sell through that platform. These fees can take many forms, including the necessity for merchants to spend more on advertising in order to gain visibility; Amazon products don’t have to pay such a levy.</p>\\r\\n<p>The term “rents” dates back to the very earliest days of modern economics, when agricultural land was still the primary source of wealth. That land was worked productively by tenant farmers, who produced value through their labor. But the bulk of the benefit was taken by the landed gentry, who lived lives of ease on the unearned income that accrued to them simply through the ownership of their vast estates. In today’s parlance, Amazon’s merchants are becoming sharecroppers. The cotton field has been replaced by a search field.</p>\\r\\n<p>Not all rents are bad. Economist Joseph Schumpeter pointed out that technological innovation often can lead to temporary rents, as innovators initially have a corner on a new product or service. But he also pointed out that these so-called Schumpeterian rents can, over time, become traditional monopolistic rents.</p>\\r\\n<p>This is what antitrust regulators should be looking at when evaluating internet platform monopolies. Has control over the algorithms and designs that allocate attention become the latest tool in the landlord’s toolbox?</p>\\r\\n<blockquote class=\"pullquote\">Big Tech has become the internet’s landlord—and rents are rising as a result.</blockquote>\\r\\n<p>In her book, <a href=\"https://marianamazzucato.com/publications/books/value-of-everything/\"><em>The Value of Everything</em></a>, economist Mariana Mazzucato makes the case that if we are really to understand the sources of inequality in our economy, economists must turn their attention back to rents. One of the central questions of classical economics was what activities are actually creating value for society, and which are merely value extracting—in effect charging a kind of tax on value that has actually been created elsewhere.</p>\\r\\n<p>In today’s neoclassical economics, rents are seen as a temporary aberration, the result of market defects that will disappear given sufficient competition. But whether we are asking fundamental questions about value creation, or merely insufficient competition, rent extraction gives us a new lens through which to consider antitrust policy.</p>\\r\\n<h2>How internet platforms increase choice</h2>\\r\\n<p>Before digital marketplaces curtailed our choices as consumers, they first expanded our options.</p>\\r\\n<p>Amazon’s virtually unlimited virtual shelf space radically expanded opportunity for both suppliers and consumers. After all, <a href=\"https://www.scrapehero.com/number-of-products-on-amazon-april-2019/\">Amazon carries 120 million unique products</a> in the US alone, compared to about 120,000 in a Walmart superstore or 35 million on walmart.com. What’s more, Amazon operates a marketplace with <a href=\"https://www.marketplacepulse.com/amazon/number-of-sellers\">over 2.5 million third-party sellers</a>, whose products, collectively, <a href=\"https://blog.aboutamazon.com/company-news/2018-letter-to-shareholders\">provide 58% of all Amazon retail revenue</a>, with only 42% coming from Amazon’s first-party retail operation.</p>\\r\\n<p>In the first-party retail operation, Amazon buys products from its suppliers and then resells them to consumers. In the third-party operation, Amazon collects fees for providing marketplace services to sellers—including display on amazon.com, warehousing, shipping, and sometimes even financing—but never legally takes possession of the companies’ merchandise. This is what allows it to have so many more products to sell than its competitors: because Amazon never takes possession of inventory but instead charges suppliers for the services it provides, the risk of offering a slow-moving product is transferred from Amazon to its suppliers.</p>\\r\\n<p>All of this appears to add up to the closest approximation ever seen in retail to what economists call “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_competition\">perfect competition</a>.” This term refers to market conditions in which a large number of sellers with offers to provide comparable products at a range of prices are met by a large number of buyers looking for those products. Those buyers are armed not only with the ability to compare the price at which products are offered, but also to compare the quality of those products via consumer ratings and reviews. In order to win the business of consumers, suppliers must not only offer the best products at the best prices, but must compete for customers to express their satisfaction with the products they have bought.</p>\\r\\n<p>So far, at least according to the statistics Bezos shared in his annual letter, the success of the Amazon marketplace is a triumph for both suppliers and consumers, and antitrust regulators should look elsewhere. As he put it, “Third-party sellers are kicking our first-party butt.”</p>\\r\\n<p>He may well be right, but there are warning signs from other internet marketplaces like Google search that suggest the situation may not be as rosy as it appears. As it turns out, regulators need to consider some additional factors in order to understand the market power of internet platforms.</p>\\r\\n<h2>How internet platforms take away choice</h2>\\r\\n<p>If Amazon has become “<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Everything-Store-Jeff-Bezos-Amazon-ebook/dp/B00BWQW73E\">the everything store</a>” for physical goods, Google is the everything store for information.</p>\\r\\n<p>Even more than Amazon, Google appears to meet the conditions for perfect competition. It matches up consumers with a near-infinite source of supply. Ask any question, and you’ll be provided with answers from hundreds or even thousands of competing content suppliers.</p>\\r\\n<p>To do this, Google <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search/howsearchworks/\">searches hundreds of billions of web pages</a> created by hundreds of millions of information suppliers. Traditional price matching is absent, since much of the content is offered for free, but Google uses hundreds of other signals to determine what answers its customers are likely to find “best.” They measure such things as the reputation of the sites linking to any other site (page rank); the words those sites use to make those links (anchor text); the content of the document itself (via an AI engine referred to as “the Google Brain”); how likely people are to click on a given result in the list, based on millions of iterations, all recorded and measured; and even whether people clicked on a link and appear to have gone away satisfied (“a long click”) or came back and clicked on another (“a short click”).</p>\\r\\n<p>The same goes for advertising on Google. Its <a href=\"https://www.wordstream.com/articles/what-is-google-adwords\">“pay per click” ad auction model</a> was a breakthrough in the direction of perfect competition: advertisers pay only when customers click on their ads. Both Google and advertisers are thus incentivized to feature ads that users actually want to see.</p>\\r\\n<p>Only about 6% of Google search results pages contain any advertising at all. Both content producers and consumers have the benefit of Google’s immense effort to index and search all web pages, not just those that are commercially valuable. Google is like a store where all of the goods are free to consumers, but some merchants pay, in the form of advertising, to have their goods placed front and center.</p>\\r\\n<p>The company is well aware of the risk that advertising will lead Google to favor the needs of advertisers over those of searchers. In fact, “Advertising and mixed motives” is the title of the appendix to Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin’s <a href=\"http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html\">original 1998 research paper on Google’s search algorithms</a>, written while they were still graduate students at Stanford.</p>\\r\\n<blockquote class=\"pullquote\">By placement on the screen and algorithmic priority, platforms have the power to shape the pages users click on and the products they decide to buy.</blockquote>\\r\\n<p>“The goals of the advertising business model do not always correspond to providing quality search to users,” they thoughtfully observed. Google made enormous efforts to overcome those mixed motives by clearly separating their advertising results from their organic results, but the company has blurred those boundaries over time, perhaps without even recognizing the extent to which they have done so.</p>\\r\\n<p>It is undeniable that the Google search results pages of today look nothing like they did when the company went public in 2004. The list of 10 “organic” results with three paid listings on the top and a sidebar of advertising results on the right that once characterized Google are long gone.</p>\\r\\n<p>Dutch search engine consultant <a href=\"https://www.edwords.nl/2014/04/27/steeds-meer-ruimte-adwords-ten-koste-van-seo/\">Eduard Blacquière documented the changes in size and placement of adwords</a> (link in Dutch), the pay-per-click advertisements that run alongside searches, between 2010 and 2014. Here’s a page he captured in June 2010, the result for a search for the word “autoverzekering” (“auto insurance” in Dutch).</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-32ri8\"><img alt=\"changes in size and placement of adwords\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Tim_1-3aeefcf98cbec1e7ea37b5dc377ba885.jpg\"><figcaption><span class=\"label\">Figure 1. </span>Screengrab: Eduard Blacquière.</figcaption></figure>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Note that the adwords at the top of the page have a background tint, and those at the side have a narrower column width, setting both off clearly from the organic results. Take a quick glance at this page, and your eye can quickly jump to the organic results while ignoring the ads if that’s what you prefer.</p>\\r\\n<p>Here is Blacquière’s dramatization of the change in size of that top block of adwords. As you can see, the ad block has both dramatically changed in size and lost its background color between 2010 and 2019, making it much harder to distinguish ads from organic results.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-3gKia\"><img alt=\"harder to distinguish ads from organic results\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Tim_2-ad3bed58be86978fd712e233fa30b1ab.jpg\"><figcaption><span class=\"label\">Figure 2. </span>Screengrab: Eduard Blacquière.</figcaption></figure>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Today, paid results can push organic results almost off the screen, so that the searcher has to scroll down to see them at all. On mobile pages with advertisements, this is almost always the case. Blacquière also documented the result of several studies done over a five-year period, which found the likelihood of a click on the first organic search result fell from over 40% in 2010 to less than 20% in 2014. This shows that through changes in homepage design alone, Google was able to shift significant attention from organic search results to ads.</p>\\r\\n<p>Not only is paid advertising supplanting organic search results, but for more and more queries, Google itself has now collected enough information to provide what it considers to be the best answer directly to the consumer, eradicating the need to send us to a third-party website at all.</p>\\r\\n<p>That’s the box that often appears above the search results when you ask a question, such as <em>What are the lyrics to “Don’t Stop Believing,”</em> or <em>What date did WWII end?; </em>the box to the right that pops up with restaurant reviews and opening hours; or a series of visual cards midway down the screen that show you the actors who appeared in a movie or different kinds of pastries common to a geographic region.</p>\\r\\n<blockquote class=\"pullquote\">Through changes in homepage design alone, Google was able to shift significant attention from organic search results to ads.</blockquote>\\r\\n<p>Where does this information come from? In 2010, with <a href=\"https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/07/deeper-understanding-with-metaweb.html\">the acquisition of Metaweb</a>, Google committed to a project it called “the knowledge graph,” a collection of facts about well-known entities such as places, people, and events. This knowledge graph provides immediate answers for many of the most common queries.</p>\\r\\n<p>The knowledge graph was initially culled from the web by ingesting information from sources such as Wikipedia, Wikidata, and the CIA Factbook, but since then, it has become far more encyclopedic and has ingested information from all over the web. In 2016, Google CEO Sundar Pichai claimed that the Google knowledge graph contained more than 70 billion facts.</p>\\r\\n<p>As shown in the figure below, for a popular search that has commercial potential, like <em>visit Yellowstone</em>, not only is the search results page dominated by paid search results (ads) and content directly supplied by Google, but Google’s “answer boxes” are themselves filled with links to other Google pages rather than to third-party websites. (Note that Google personalizes results and also runs hundreds of thousands of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing\">A/B tests</a> a day on the effect of minor changes in position, so your own results for this identical search may have different results than are shown here.)</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-8jiEn\"><img alt=\"google search results\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Tim_3-fb67a3cd5204ae994f4ab9c004966fb4.png\"><figcaption><span class=\"label\">Figure 3. </span>Screengrab: Tim O\\'Reilly.</figcaption></figure>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>As of March 2017, user clickstream data provided by web analytics firm Jumpshot suggests that <a href=\"https://moz.com/blog/state-of-searcher-behavior-revealed\">up to 40% of all Google queries no longer result in a click through to an external website</a>. Think of all the questions you go to Google for that no longer require a second click: what’s the weather? What’s the current value of the euro against the dollar? What’s that song that’s playing in the background? What’s the best local restaurant? Biographies of eminent people, descriptions of cities, neighborhoods, businesses, historical events, quotes by famous authors, song lyrics, stock prices, and flight times all now appear as immediate answers from Google.</p>\\r\\n<p>I am not necessarily suggesting anti-competitive intent. Google claims, with considerable justice, that all of these changes to search engine result pages are designed to improve user experience. And indeed, it is often helpful to get an immediate answer to a query rather than having to click through to another web site. Furthermore, much of this data is in fact licensed. But these deals seem like a step backward from the perfect competition represented by Google’s original reliance on multi-factor search algorithms to surface the very best information from independent web sites.</p>\\r\\n<p>The net effect on Google’s financial performance is striking. In 2004, the year that Google went public, it had two principal advertising revenue engines: Adwords (those pay-per-click advertisements that run alongside searches on Google’s own site) and Adsense (pay-per-click advertisements that Google places on third-party websites on their behalf, either in search results on their site or directly alongside their content). In 2004, the two revenue sources were very close to equal. But by 2018, Google’s revenue from advertising on its own properties <a href=\"https://qz.com/1540608/the-problem-with-silicon-valleys-obsession-with-blitzscaling-growth/\">had grown to 82% of its total advertising revenue, with only 18% coming from the advertising it provides on third–party sites</a>.</p>\\r\\n<p>These examples illustrate the power of a platform to shape, both by placement on the screen and algorithmic priority, the pages users click on and the products they decide to buy—and therefore also the economic success for the supply side of its marketplace. Google maintains a rigorous separation between the search and advertising teams, but despite that fact, changes in the layout of Google’s pages and its algorithms have played an enormous role in shaping the attention of its users to favor those who advertise with Google.</p>\\r\\n<p>When Google decides unilaterally on the size and position that its own products take on the screen, it also stops consumers from organically deciding what content to click on or what socks to buy. That’s what antitrust regulators should be considering: whether the algorithmic and design control exerted by sites like Google or Amazon reduces the choices we have as consumers.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Maintaining the illusion of choice</h2>\\r\\n<p>If Google has monopolized our access to information, Amazon’s fast-growing advertising business is now shaping what products consumers are actually given to choose from. Have they, too, taken a bite from the poisoned apple of advertising’s mixed motives?</p>\\r\\n<blockquote class=\"pullquote\">Amazon’s merchants are becoming sharecroppers. The cotton field has been replaced by a search field.</blockquote>\\r\\n<p>Like Google, Amazon used to rely heavily on the collective intelligence of its users to recommend the best products from its suppliers. It did this by using information such as the supplier-provided description of the product, the number and quality of reviews, the number of inbound links, the sales rank of similar products, and so on, to determine the order in which search results would appear. These were all factored into Amazon’s default search ranking, which put products that were considered “Most Popular” first.</p>\\r\\n<p>But as with Google, this eden of internet collective intelligence may be in danger of coming to an end.</p>\\r\\n<p>In the example below, you can see that the default search for “best science fiction books” on Amazon now turns up only “Featured” (i.e., paid for) products. Are these the results you’d expect from this search? Where are the Hugo and Nebula award winners? Where are the books and authors with thousands of five-star reviews?</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-LDibA\"><img alt=\"default search results\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Tim_4-669745af115a715eac3f72debc36432b.png\"></figure>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Contrast these results for those for the same search on Google, shown in the figure below. A knowledgeable science-fiction fan might quibble with some of these selections, but this is indeed a list of widely acknowledged classics in the field. In this case, Google presents no advertising, and so the results instead simply reflect the collective intelligence of what the web thinks is best.</p>\\r\\n<p>While this might be taken as a reflection of the superiority of Google’s search algorithms over Amazon’s, the more important point is to note how differently a platform treats results when it has no particular commercial axe to grind.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-eQiAn\"><img alt=\"how differently a platform treats results when it has no particular commercial axe to grind\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Tim_5-43fd641ca4d9e3970ba558ff5365ce89.png\"></figure>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Amazon has long claimed that the company is <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/greg-satell/the-secret-behind-amazons-uncanny-ability-to-out-innovate-just-about-every-other-company-on-planet.html\">fanatically focused on the needs of its customers</a>. A search like the one shown above, which favors paid results, demonstrates how far the quest for advertising dollars takes them from that avowed goal.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Advice for antitrust regulators</h2>\\r\\n<p>So, how are we therefore best to decide if these Big Tech platforms need to be regulated?</p>\\r\\n<p>In one famous exchange, Bill Gates, the founder and former CEO of Microsoft, <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2018/the-bill-gates-line/\">told Chamath Palihapitiya</a>, the one-time head of the Facebook platform:</p>\\r\\n<blockquote>\\r\\n<p>“This isn’t a platform. A platform is when the economic value of everybody that uses it exceeds the value of the company that creates it. Then it’s a platform.”</p>\\r\\n</blockquote>\\r\\n<p>Given this understanding of the role of a platform, regulators should be looking to measure whether companies like Amazon or Google are continuing to provide opportunity for their ecosystem of suppliers, or if they’re increasing their own returns at the expense of that ecosystem.</p>\\r\\n<p>Rather than just asking whether consumers benefit in the short term from the companies’ actions, regulators should be looking at the long-term health of the marketplace of suppliers—they are the real source of that consumer benefit, not the platforms alone. Have Amazon, Apple, or Google <em>earned</em> their profits, or are they coming from monopolistic rents?</p>\\r\\n<p>How might we know whether a company operating an algorithmically managed marketplace is extracting rents rather than simply taking a reasonable cut for the services it provides? The first sign may not be that it is raising prices for consumers, but that it is taking a larger percentage from its suppliers, or competing unfairly with them.</p>\\r\\n<p>Before antitrust authorities look to remedies like breaking up these companies, a good first step would be to require disclosure of information about the growth and health of the supply side of their marketplaces. The statistics about the growth of its third-party marketplace that Bezos trumpeted in his shareholder letter tell only half the story. The questions to ask are who profits, by how much, and how that allocation of rewards is changing over time.</p>\\r\\n<p>Regulators such as the SEC should require regular financial reporting on the allocation of value between the platform and its marketplace. I have done limited analysis for Google and Amazon based on information provided in their annual public filings, but much of the information required for a rigorous analysis is just not available.</p>\\r\\n<p>Google provides an annual economic impact report analyzing value provided to its advertisers, but there is no comparable report for the value created for its content suppliers. Nor is there any visibility into the changing fortunes of app suppliers into the Play Store, Google’s Android app marketplace, or into the fortunes of content providers on YouTube.</p>\\r\\n<p>Questions of who gets what and why must be asked of Amazon’s marketplace and its other operating units, <a href=\"https://onezero.medium.com/open-source-betrayed-industry-leaders-accuse-amazon-of-playing-a-rigged-game-with-aws-67177bc748b7\">including its dominant cloud-computing division</a>, or Apple’s App Store. The role of Facebook’s algorithms in deciding what content appears in its readers’ newsfeeds has been widely scrutinized with regard to political bias and manipulation by hostile actors, but there’s been little rigorous economic analysis of <em>economic bias</em> in the algorithms of any of these companies.</p>\\r\\n<p>Data is the currency of these companies. It should also be the currency of those looking to regulate them. You cannot regulate what you don’t understand.

Yesterday, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/congress-puts-big-tech-in-crosshairs-11563311754\">a US subcommittee on antitrust</a> grilled representatives from Amazon, Google, Facebook, and Apple in Congress, and presidential candidates have gone so far as to suggest that <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/08/politics/elizabeth-warren-amazon-google-facebook/index.html\">these behemoths should be broken up</a>. In the European Union, regulation is already happening: in March, the EU levied its <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/20/business/google-fine-advertising.html\">third multibillion-dollar fine against Google</a>for anti-competitive behavior.</p>\\r\\n<p>In <a href=\"https://blog.aboutamazon.com/company-news/2018-letter-to-shareholders\">his 2018 letter to shareholders</a>, published this past April, Jeff Bezos was already prepping for conversations with regulators. He doesn’t think Amazon is a monopoly. Instead, the company’s founder argues it is “just a small player in global retail.”</p>\\r\\n<p>In Bezos’s defense, for many of the products Amazon sells, there are indeed many alternative sources, suggesting plenty of competition. Despite Amazon’s leadership in online retail, <a href=\"https://mgmresearch.com/amazon-vs-walmart-revenues-and-profits-comparison-1999-2018/\">Walmart is more than double Amazon’s size </a>as a general retailer, with Costco not far behind Amazon. Specialty retailers like Walgreens and CVS in the pharmacy world and Kroger and Albertson’s in groceries also dwarf Amazon’s presence in their categories.</p>\\r\\n<p>But Amazon does not just compete with Walmart, CVS, Kroger, and other retailers—it also competes with the merchants who sell products through its platform.</p>\\r\\n<p>This competition isn’t just the obvious kind, such as the Amazon Basics-branded batteries that by 2016 represented <a href=\"https://www.1010data.com/company/blog/market-insights-series-amazon-s-advance-the-battle-of-batteries/\">one third of all online battery sales</a>, as well as similar Amazon products in audio, home electronics, baby wipes, bed sheets, and kitchenware. Amazon also competes with its merchants for visibility on its platform, and charges them additional fees for favored placement. And because Amazon is now leading with featured products rather than those its customers think are the best, its merchants are incentivized to advertise on the platform. Amazon’s fast-growing advertising business is thus a kind of tax on its merchants.</p>\\r\\n<p>Likewise, Google does not just compete with other search engines like Bing and DuckDuckGo, but with everyone who produces content on the world wide web. Apple’s iPhone and Google’s Android don’t just compete with each other as smartphone platforms, but also with the app vendors who rely on smartphones to sell their products.</p>\\r\\n<p>This kind of competition is taken for granted by antitrust regulators, who are generally more concerned with the end cost for consumers. And as anyone who has shopped online will know, Amazon is nearly always the cheaper option. (In fact, surveys have suggested that between <a href=\"https://marketingland.com/online-shoppers-use-amazon-to-compare-products-259139\">seven</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2016/09/27/amazon-is-the-first-place-most-online-shoppers-visit.html\">nine</a> out of 10 Americans will check Amazon to compare the price of a purchase.) As long as the monopoly doesn’t lead to us forking out more money, then antitrust regulators traditionally leave it alone.</p>\\r\\n<p>However, this view of antitrust leaves out some unique characteristics of digital platforms and marketplaces. These giants don’t just compete on the basis of product quality and price—they control the market through the algorithms and design features that decide which products users will see and be able to choose from. And these choices are not always in consumers’ best interests.</p>\\r\\n<h2>A fresh approach to antitrust</h2>\\r\\n<p>All of the internet giants—Amazon, Google, Facebook, and insofar as app stores are considered, Apple—provide the illusion of free markets, in which billions of consumers choose among millions of suppliers’ offerings, which compete on the basis of price, quality, and availability.</p>\\r\\n<p>But if you recognize that what consumers really choose from is not the universe of all possible products, but those that are offered up to them either on the homepage or the search screen, the “shelf space” provided by these platforms is in fact far more limited than the tiniest of local markets—and what is placed on that shelf is uniquely under the control of the platform owner. And with mobile playing a larger and larger role, that digital shelf space is visibly shrinking rather than growing.</p>\\r\\n<p>In short, the designers of marketplace-platform algorithms and screen layouts can arbitrarily allocate value to whom they choose. The marketplace is designed and controlled by its owners, and that design shapes “<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Who-Gets-What-Why-Matchmaking/dp/0544705289\">who gets what and why</a>” (to use the marvelous phrase from Alvin E. Roth, who received a Nobel prize in economics for his foundational work in the field of market design.)</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>When it comes to antitrust, the question of market power must be answered by analyzing the effect of these marketplace designs on both buyers and sellers, and how they change over time. How much of the value goes to the platform, how much to consumers, and how much to suppliers?</p>\\r\\n<p>The platforms have the power to take advantage of either side of their marketplace. Any abuse of market power is likely to show up first on the supply side. A dominant platform can squeeze its suppliers while continuing to pass along part of the benefit to consumers—but keeping more and more of it for themselves.</p>\\r\\n<p>Over time, though, consumers feel the bite. Power over sellers ultimately translates into power over customers as well. As the platform owner favors its own offerings over those of its suppliers, choice is reduced, though it is only in the endgame that consumer pricing—the typical measure of a monopoly—begins to be affected.</p>\\r\\n<p>The control that the platforms have over placement and visibility puts them in a unique position to collect what economists call <em>rents</em>: that is, value extracted through the ownership of a limited resource. These rents may come in the form of additional advantage given to the marketplace’s own private-label products, but also through the fees that are paid by merchants who sell through that platform. These fees can take many forms, including the necessity for merchants to spend more on advertising in order to gain visibility; Amazon products don’t have to pay such a levy.</p>\\r\\n<p>The term “rents” dates back to the very earliest days of modern economics, when agricultural land was still the primary source of wealth. That land was worked productively by tenant farmers, who produced value through their labor. But the bulk of the benefit was taken by the landed gentry, who lived lives of ease on the unearned income that accrued to them simply through the ownership of their vast estates. In today’s parlance, Amazon’s merchants are becoming sharecroppers. The cotton field has been replaced by a search field.</p>\\r\\n<p>Not all rents are bad. Economist Joseph Schumpeter pointed out that technological innovation often can lead to temporary rents, as innovators initially have a corner on a new product or service. But he also pointed out that these so-called Schumpeterian rents can, over time, become traditional monopolistic rents.</p>\\r\\n<p>This is what antitrust regulators should be looking at when evaluating internet platform monopolies. Has control over the algorithms and designs that allocate attention become the latest tool in the landlord’s toolbox?</p>\\r\\n<blockquote class=\"pullquote\">Big Tech has become the internet’s landlord—and rents are rising as a result.</blockquote>\\r\\n<p>In her book, <a href=\"https://marianamazzucato.com/publications/books/value-of-everything/\"><em>The Value of Everything</em></a>, economist Mariana Mazzucato makes the case that if we are really to understand the sources of inequality in our economy, economists must turn their attention back to rents. One of the central questions of classical economics was what activities are actually creating value for society, and which are merely value extracting—in effect charging a kind of tax on value that has actually been created elsewhere.</p>\\r\\n<p>In today’s neoclassical economics, rents are seen as a temporary aberration, the result of market defects that will disappear given sufficient competition. But whether we are asking fundamental questions about value creation, or merely insufficient competition, rent extraction gives us a new lens through which to consider antitrust policy.</p>\\r\\n<h2>How internet platforms increase choice</h2>\\r\\n<p>Before digital marketplaces curtailed our choices as consumers, they first expanded our options.</p>\\r\\n<p>Amazon’s virtually unlimited virtual shelf space radically expanded opportunity for both suppliers and consumers. After all, <a href=\"https://www.scrapehero.com/number-of-products-on-amazon-april-2019/\">Amazon carries 120 million unique products</a> in the US alone, compared to about 120,000 in a Walmart superstore or 35 million on walmart.com. What’s more, Amazon operates a marketplace with <a href=\"https://www.marketplacepulse.com/amazon/number-of-sellers\">over 2.5 million third-party sellers</a>, whose products, collectively, <a href=\"https://blog.aboutamazon.com/company-news/2018-letter-to-shareholders\">provide 58% of all Amazon retail revenue</a>, with only 42% coming from Amazon’s first-party retail operation.</p>\\r\\n<p>In the first-party retail operation, Amazon buys products from its suppliers and then resells them to consumers. In the third-party operation, Amazon collects fees for providing marketplace services to sellers—including display on amazon.com, warehousing, shipping, and sometimes even financing—but never legally takes possession of the companies’ merchandise. This is what allows it to have so many more products to sell than its competitors: because Amazon never takes possession of inventory but instead charges suppliers for the services it provides, the risk of offering a slow-moving product is transferred from Amazon to its suppliers.</p>\\r\\n<p>All of this appears to add up to the closest approximation ever seen in retail to what economists call “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_competition\">perfect competition</a>.” This term refers to market conditions in which a large number of sellers with offers to provide comparable products at a range of prices are met by a large number of buyers looking for those products. Those buyers are armed not only with the ability to compare the price at which products are offered, but also to compare the quality of those products via consumer ratings and reviews. In order to win the business of consumers, suppliers must not only offer the best products at the best prices, but must compete for customers to express their satisfaction with the products they have bought.</p>\\r\\n<p>So far, at least according to the statistics Bezos shared in his annual letter, the success of the Amazon marketplace is a triumph for both suppliers and consumers, and antitrust regulators should look elsewhere. As he put it, “Third-party sellers are kicking our first-party butt.”</p>\\r\\n<p>He may well be right, but there are warning signs from other internet marketplaces like Google search that suggest the situation may not be as rosy as it appears. As it turns out, regulators need to consider some additional factors in order to understand the market power of internet platforms.</p>\\r\\n<h2>How internet platforms take away choice</h2>\\r\\n<p>If Amazon has become “<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Everything-Store-Jeff-Bezos-Amazon-ebook/dp/B00BWQW73E\">the everything store</a>” for physical goods, Google is the everything store for information.</p>\\r\\n<p>Even more than Amazon, Google appears to meet the conditions for perfect competition. It matches up consumers with a near-infinite source of supply. Ask any question, and you’ll be provided with answers from hundreds or even thousands of competing content suppliers.</p>\\r\\n<p>To do this, Google <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search/howsearchworks/\">searches hundreds of billions of web pages</a> created by hundreds of millions of information suppliers. Traditional price matching is absent, since much of the content is offered for free, but Google uses hundreds of other signals to determine what answers its customers are likely to find “best.” They measure such things as the reputation of the sites linking to any other site (page rank); the words those sites use to make those links (anchor text); the content of the document itself (via an AI engine referred to as “the Google Brain”); how likely people are to click on a given result in the list, based on millions of iterations, all recorded and measured; and even whether people clicked on a link and appear to have gone away satisfied (“a long click”) or came back and clicked on another (“a short click”).</p>\\r\\n<p>The same goes for advertising on Google. Its <a href=\"https://www.wordstream.com/articles/what-is-google-adwords\">“pay per click” ad auction model</a> was a breakthrough in the direction of perfect competition: advertisers pay only when customers click on their ads. Both Google and advertisers are thus incentivized to feature ads that users actually want to see.</p>\\r\\n<p>Only about 6% of Google search results pages contain any advertising at all. Both content producers and consumers have the benefit of Google’s immense effort to index and search all web pages, not just those that are commercially valuable. Google is like a store where all of the goods are free to consumers, but some merchants pay, in the form of advertising, to have their goods placed front and center.</p>\\r\\n<p>The company is well aware of the risk that advertising will lead Google to favor the needs of advertisers over those of searchers. In fact, “Advertising and mixed motives” is the title of the appendix to Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin’s <a href=\"http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html\">original 1998 research paper on Google’s search algorithms</a>, written while they were still graduate students at Stanford.</p>\\r\\n<blockquote class=\"pullquote\">By placement on the screen and algorithmic priority, platforms have the power to shape the pages users click on and the products they decide to buy.</blockquote>\\r\\n<p>“The goals of the advertising business model do not always correspond to providing quality search to users,” they thoughtfully observed. Google made enormous efforts to overcome those mixed motives by clearly separating their advertising results from their organic results, but the company has blurred those boundaries over time, perhaps without even recognizing the extent to which they have done so.</p>\\r\\n<p>It is undeniable that the Google search results pages of today look nothing like they did when the company went public in 2004. The list of 10 “organic” results with three paid listings on the top and a sidebar of advertising results on the right that once characterized Google are long gone.</p>\\r\\n<p>Dutch search engine consultant <a href=\"https://www.edwords.nl/2014/04/27/steeds-meer-ruimte-adwords-ten-koste-van-seo/\">Eduard Blacquière documented the changes in size and placement of adwords</a> (link in Dutch), the pay-per-click advertisements that run alongside searches, between 2010 and 2014. Here’s a page he captured in June 2010, the result for a search for the word “autoverzekering” (“auto insurance” in Dutch).</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-32ri8\"><img alt=\"changes in size and placement of adwords\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Tim_1-3aeefcf98cbec1e7ea37b5dc377ba885.jpg\"><figcaption><span class=\"label\">Figure 1. </span>Screengrab: Eduard Blacquière.</figcaption></figure>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Note that the adwords at the top of the page have a background tint, and those at the side have a narrower column width, setting both off clearly from the organic results. Take a quick glance at this page, and your eye can quickly jump to the organic results while ignoring the ads if that’s what you prefer.</p>\\r\\n<p>Here is Blacquière’s dramatization of the change in size of that top block of adwords. As you can see, the ad block has both dramatically changed in size and lost its background color between 2010 and 2019, making it much harder to distinguish ads from organic results.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-3gKia\"><img alt=\"harder to distinguish ads from organic results\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Tim_2-ad3bed58be86978fd712e233fa30b1ab.jpg\"><figcaption><span class=\"label\">Figure 2. </span>Screengrab: Eduard Blacquière.</figcaption></figure>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Today, paid results can push organic results almost off the screen, so that the searcher has to scroll down to see them at all. On mobile pages with advertisements, this is almost always the case. Blacquière also documented the result of several studies done over a five-year period, which found the likelihood of a click on the first organic search result fell from over 40% in 2010 to less than 20% in 2014. This shows that through changes in homepage design alone, Google was able to shift significant attention from organic search results to ads.</p>\\r\\n<p>Not only is paid advertising supplanting organic search results, but for more and more queries, Google itself has now collected enough information to provide what it considers to be the best answer directly to the consumer, eradicating the need to send us to a third-party website at all.</p>\\r\\n<p>That’s the box that often appears above the search results when you ask a question, such as <em>What are the lyrics to “Don’t Stop Believing,”</em> or <em>What date did WWII end?; </em>the box to the right that pops up with restaurant reviews and opening hours; or a series of visual cards midway down the screen that show you the actors who appeared in a movie or different kinds of pastries common to a geographic region.</p>\\r\\n<blockquote class=\"pullquote\">Through changes in homepage design alone, Google was able to shift significant attention from organic search results to ads.</blockquote>\\r\\n<p>Where does this information come from? In 2010, with <a href=\"https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/07/deeper-understanding-with-metaweb.html\">the acquisition of Metaweb</a>, Google committed to a project it called “the knowledge graph,” a collection of facts about well-known entities such as places, people, and events. This knowledge graph provides immediate answers for many of the most common queries.</p>\\r\\n<p>The knowledge graph was initially culled from the web by ingesting information from sources such as Wikipedia, Wikidata, and the CIA Factbook, but since then, it has become far more encyclopedic and has ingested information from all over the web. In 2016, Google CEO Sundar Pichai claimed that the Google knowledge graph contained more than 70 billion facts.</p>\\r\\n<p>As shown in the figure below, for a popular search that has commercial potential, like <em>visit Yellowstone</em>, not only is the search results page dominated by paid search results (ads) and content directly supplied by Google, but Google’s “answer boxes” are themselves filled with links to other Google pages rather than to third-party websites. (Note that Google personalizes results and also runs hundreds of thousands of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing\">A/B tests</a> a day on the effect of minor changes in position, so your own results for this identical search may have different results than are shown here.)</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-8jiEn\"><img alt=\"google search results\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Tim_3-fb67a3cd5204ae994f4ab9c004966fb4.png\"><figcaption><span class=\"label\">Figure 3. </span>Screengrab: Tim O\\'Reilly.</figcaption></figure>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>As of March 2017, user clickstream data provided by web analytics firm Jumpshot suggests that <a href=\"https://moz.com/blog/state-of-searcher-behavior-revealed\">up to 40% of all Google queries no longer result in a click through to an external website</a>. Think of all the questions you go to Google for that no longer require a second click: what’s the weather? What’s the current value of the euro against the dollar? What’s that song that’s playing in the background? What’s the best local restaurant? Biographies of eminent people, descriptions of cities, neighborhoods, businesses, historical events, quotes by famous authors, song lyrics, stock prices, and flight times all now appear as immediate answers from Google.</p>\\r\\n<p>I am not necessarily suggesting anti-competitive intent. Google claims, with considerable justice, that all of these changes to search engine result pages are designed to improve user experience. And indeed, it is often helpful to get an immediate answer to a query rather than having to click through to another web site. Furthermore, much of this data is in fact licensed. But these deals seem like a step backward from the perfect competition represented by Google’s original reliance on multi-factor search algorithms to surface the very best information from independent web sites.</p>\\r\\n<p>The net effect on Google’s financial performance is striking. In 2004, the year that Google went public, it had two principal advertising revenue engines: Adwords (those pay-per-click advertisements that run alongside searches on Google’s own site) and Adsense (pay-per-click advertisements that Google places on third-party websites on their behalf, either in search results on their site or directly alongside their content). In 2004, the two revenue sources were very close to equal. But by 2018, Google’s revenue from advertising on its own properties <a href=\"https://qz.com/1540608/the-problem-with-silicon-valleys-obsession-with-blitzscaling-growth/\">had grown to 82% of its total advertising revenue, with only 18% coming from the advertising it provides on third–party sites</a>.</p>\\r\\n<p>These examples illustrate the power of a platform to shape, both by placement on the screen and algorithmic priority, the pages users click on and the products they decide to buy—and therefore also the economic success for the supply side of its marketplace. Google maintains a rigorous separation between the search and advertising teams, but despite that fact, changes in the layout of Google’s pages and its algorithms have played an enormous role in shaping the attention of its users to favor those who advertise with Google.</p>\\r\\n<p>When Google decides unilaterally on the size and position that its own products take on the screen, it also stops consumers from organically deciding what content to click on or what socks to buy. That’s what antitrust regulators should be considering: whether the algorithmic and design control exerted by sites like Google or Amazon reduces the choices we have as consumers.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Maintaining the illusion of choice</h2>\\r\\n<p>If Google has monopolized our access to information, Amazon’s fast-growing advertising business is now shaping what products consumers are actually given to choose from. Have they, too, taken a bite from the poisoned apple of advertising’s mixed motives?</p>\\r\\n<blockquote class=\"pullquote\">Amazon’s merchants are becoming sharecroppers. The cotton field has been replaced by a search field.</blockquote>\\r\\n<p>Like Google, Amazon used to rely heavily on the collective intelligence of its users to recommend the best products from its suppliers. It did this by using information such as the supplier-provided description of the product, the number and quality of reviews, the number of inbound links, the sales rank of similar products, and so on, to determine the order in which search results would appear. These were all factored into Amazon’s default search ranking, which put products that were considered “Most Popular” first.</p>\\r\\n<p>But as with Google, this eden of internet collective intelligence may be in danger of coming to an end.</p>\\r\\n<p>In the example below, you can see that the default search for “best science fiction books” on Amazon now turns up only “Featured” (i.e., paid for) products. Are these the results you’d expect from this search? Where are the Hugo and Nebula award winners? Where are the books and authors with thousands of five-star reviews?</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-LDibA\"><img alt=\"default search results\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Tim_4-669745af115a715eac3f72debc36432b.png\"></figure>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Contrast these results for those for the same search on Google, shown in the figure below. A knowledgeable science-fiction fan might quibble with some of these selections, but this is indeed a list of widely acknowledged classics in the field. In this case, Google presents no advertising, and so the results instead simply reflect the collective intelligence of what the web thinks is best.</p>\\r\\n<p>While this might be taken as a reflection of the superiority of Google’s search algorithms over Amazon’s, the more important point is to note how differently a platform treats results when it has no particular commercial axe to grind.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-eQiAn\"><img alt=\"how differently a platform treats results when it has no particular commercial axe to grind\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Tim_5-43fd641ca4d9e3970ba558ff5365ce89.png\"></figure>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Amazon has long claimed that the company is <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/greg-satell/the-secret-behind-amazons-uncanny-ability-to-out-innovate-just-about-every-other-company-on-planet.html\">fanatically focused on the needs of its customers</a>. A search like the one shown above, which favors paid results, demonstrates how far the quest for advertising dollars takes them from that avowed goal.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Advice for antitrust regulators</h2>\\r\\n<p>So, how are we therefore best to decide if these Big Tech platforms need to be regulated?</p>\\r\\n<p>In one famous exchange, Bill Gates, the founder and former CEO of Microsoft, <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2018/the-bill-gates-line/\">told Chamath Palihapitiya</a>, the one-time head of the Facebook platform:</p>\\r\\n<blockquote>\\r\\n<p>“This isn’t a platform. A platform is when the economic value of everybody that uses it exceeds the value of the company that creates it. Then it’s a platform.”</p>\\r\\n</blockquote>\\r\\n<p>Given this understanding of the role of a platform, regulators should be looking to measure whether companies like Amazon or Google are continuing to provide opportunity for their ecosystem of suppliers, or if they’re increasing their own returns at the expense of that ecosystem.</p>\\r\\n<p>Rather than just asking whether consumers benefit in the short term from the companies’ actions, regulators should be looking at the long-term health of the marketplace of suppliers—they are the real source of that consumer benefit, not the platforms alone. Have Amazon, Apple, or Google <em>earned</em> their profits, or are they coming from monopolistic rents?</p>\\r\\n<p>How might we know whether a company operating an algorithmically managed marketplace is extracting rents rather than simply taking a reasonable cut for the services it provides? The first sign may not be that it is raising prices for consumers, but that it is taking a larger percentage from its suppliers, or competing unfairly with them.</p>\\r\\n<p>Before antitrust authorities look to remedies like breaking up these companies, a good first step would be to require disclosure of information about the growth and health of the supply side of their marketplaces. The statistics about the growth of its third-party marketplace that Bezos trumpeted in his shareholder letter tell only half the story. The questions to ask are who profits, by how much, and how that allocation of rewards is changing over time.</p>\\r\\n<p>Regulators such as the SEC should require regular financial reporting on the allocation of value between the platform and its marketplace. I have done limited analysis for Google and Amazon based on information provided in their annual public filings, but much of the information required for a rigorous analysis is just not available.</p>\\r\\n<p>Google provides an annual economic impact report analyzing value provided to its advertisers, but there is no comparable report for the value created for its content suppliers. Nor is there any visibility into the changing fortunes of app suppliers into the Play Store, Google’s Android app marketplace, or into the fortunes of content providers on YouTube.</p>\\r\\n<p>Questions of who gets what and why must be asked of Amazon’s marketplace and its other operating units, <a href=\"https://onezero.medium.com/open-source-betrayed-industry-leaders-accuse-amazon-of-playing-a-rigged-game-with-aws-67177bc748b7\">including its dominant cloud-computing division</a>, or Apple’s App Store. The role of Facebook’s algorithms in deciding what content appears in its readers’ newsfeeds has been widely scrutinized with regard to political bias and manipulation by hostile actors, but there’s been little rigorous economic analysis of <em>economic bias</em> in the algorithms of any of these companies.</p>\\r\\n<p>Data is the currency of these companies. It should also be the currency of those looking to regulate them. You cannot regulate what you don’t understand. The algorithms that these companies use may be defended as trade secrets, but their outcomes should be open to inspection.</p>\\r\\n<p>Continue reading <a href=\\'https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/antitrust-regulators-are-using-the-wrong-tools-to-break-up-big-tech\\'>Antitrust regulators are using the wrong tools to break up Big Tech.</a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/LKjkCKA4W2s\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>',\n",

It makes sense to deploy a blockchain-based solution only where there is a network of collaborating participants who are issuing transactions around a set of common assets in the network. In this article, we’ll identify the initial crucial steps to identifying scenarios for a successful blockchain-based solution, and the first steps toward transforming your business model.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Our first observation of when blockchain is the right solution is that there must be a <em>business network of multiple participants</em>. Our second would be that they require a shared view of assets and their associated transactions.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>We then use the following four key blockchain features to further define the benefits of a blockchain-based solution:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Consensus</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The process of agreeing on new transactions and distributing them to participants in the network.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Provenance</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>A complete history of all transactions related to the assets recorded on the blockchain.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Immutability</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Once a transaction has been stored on the blockchain, it cannot be edited, deleted, or have transactions inserted before it.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Finality</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Once a transaction is committed to the blockchain, it is considered “final” and can no longer be “rolled back” or undone.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>There are several other blockchain benefits that underpin these four key benefits, and are worth keeping in mind as you review any potential scenarios:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Identity</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>All participants in a permissioned blockchain network have an identity in the form of a digital certificate—the same technology that underpins the security and trust when we use a web browser to access our online bank.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Security</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Every transaction in the permissioned network is <em>cryptographically signed</em>, which provides <em>authenticity</em> of which participant sent it, <em>nonrepudiation</em> (meaning they can’t deny sending it), and <em>integrity</em> (meaning it hasn’t been changed since it was sent).</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Contracts</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><em>Smart contracts</em> hold the business logic for transactions and are executed across the network by the participants endorsing a transaction.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>These benefits help engender trust between the participants in busi‐ ness networks, and we can use them as a litmus test when checking to see if blockchain is a good technology fit. We should note that while it’s not necessary for a scenario to require every benefit just listed, the more that are required, the more the case is strengthened for using blockchain.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>We should always be wary of thinking that blockchain is a panacea for all solutions. There are many reasons why blockchain <em>wouldn’t</em> be a good fit. For example:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>Blockchain is not suitable if there’s only a single participant in the business network.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>Although we talk about transactions and world state databases in blockchain, it shouldn’t be thought of as a replacement for traditional database or transaction servers.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>Blockchain by design is a distributed peer-to-peer network, and is heavily based on cryptography. With this comes a number of nonfunctional requirement considerations. For example, performance and latency won’t match a traditional database or transaction server, but scalability, redundancy, and high availability are built in.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Assets, participants, and transactions </h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>When thinking about a potential blockchain solution and the benefits it brings to the network of participants, it is useful to view it in relation to the following concepts:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>Assets</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Participants</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Transactions</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>We have already introduced some examples of these. They are core concepts in a blockchain network that benefit from the four primary trust benefits introduced in the previous section.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Assets </strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Either purely digital, or backed by a physical object, an <em>asset </em>represents something that is recorded on the blockchain. The asset may be shared across the whole network, or can be kept private depending on the requirements. A smart contract defines the asset.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Participants </strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><em>Participants </em>occupy different levels in a blockchain network. There are those participants who run parts of the network and endorse transactions. Other members may consume services of the network but may rely on and trust other participants to run the network and endorse transactions. Then there are the end users who are interacting with the blockchain network through a user interface. The end user may not even be aware that a blockchain underpins the system.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Transactions </strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The transactions are coded inside the smart contracts alongside the assets to which the transactions belong. Think of the transactions as the interaction points between the assets and the participants; a participant can create, delete, and update a given asset, assuming they are authorized to do so. It is these transactions that are stored immutably on the blockchain, which also provides the provenance of any changes to the asset over time.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>The blockchain fit </strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>First and foremost is to check there is a business network in place. Identify how many suppliers and partners are involved in both the internal and external network. If there is a good business network in place, consider the rest of the blockchain features.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>As some of the disputes are related to differences between what was ordered and subsequently received, this can often be the result of different participants in a business network (partners, suppliers, and delivery companies) tracking goods in separate siloed systems.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Therefore, a shared ledger with consensus and finality provided by blockchain across the business network will help to reduce the overall number of disputes as it will give all participants the same information on the assets being tracked.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Furthermore, if changes to the data being tracked either intentionally or unintentionally are part of the root cause of these disputes, then the provenance and immutability features of blockchain could also help.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Last, consider the amount of time taken to resolve these issues. If there are multiple systems (including third-party systems) that someone needs to check in order to resolve any transactions in dispute, having a single shared ledger that is maintained through consensus will help reduce the time taken to resolve them.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Some further observations about how a blockchain-based solution can benefit this business network:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>Each participant in the business network has an identity and is permissioned in the network. This could help with your processes related to know your customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML).</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Smart contracts could be designed to resolve some of the disputes automatically by maintaining consistency across the business network and therefore further reducing the number of disputes.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Choosing a first scenario </strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>You may be considering multiple scenarios where blockchain provides a good solution fit. In this case, you will need to compare each to determine which is the best scenario to work on first.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>We recommend a simple approach for comparing each scenario using a quadrant chart, where each is placed on the chart based on its relative benefit and simplicity.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In Figure 1, the x-axis is the simplicity of the scenario (simpler to the right) and the y-axis represents the benefit (more beneficial to the top). Place each scenario on the quadrant chart, considering its expected benefit and simplicity as a blockchain solution. This is best done as a group exercise with appropriate stakeholders who can provide the necessary insight to where each scenario falls in the chart based on level of simplicity and potential benefits.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Once all scenarios have been plotted on the chart, it becomes obvious which are the first scenarios to concentrate on—those that will provide the most benefits and are the simplest.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-YOiex\"><img alt=\"blockchain benefits and scenarios\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/image_1-2-a73a051398ec2b1a4a90eaed951f5320.jpg\"><figcaption><span class=\"label\">Figure 1. </span>Comparing scenarios based on their benefit and simplicity</figcaption></figure>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Transforming the business network</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Once your first blockchain scenario has been identified, you will want to move to the next phase: building the minimal viable product (MVP). An MVP represents the minimum product that can be built to accomplish a goal of the blockchain scenario. Starting an MVP with blockchain shouldn’t be dissimilar to any other technology, and good software engineering practices, such as using Agile principles, will always be applicable. Following are some observations that will help as you start to transform your business with a new blockchain-based solution:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>Blockchain is a team sport. There will be multiple stakeholders from different organizations in the business network. Some of these organizations may not have traditionally worked directly with one another. Therefore, a clear understanding of the requirements and issues across all participants, and clear lines of communication and agreement, are critical to the success of the project.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Use design thinking techniques that focus on the goals for the user to agree on the scope of the MVP.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Use agile software engineering best practices, such as continuous integration and stakeholder feedback, to iterate throughout the development of the MVP. Keep stakeholders informed and act on feedback.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Start with a small network and grow. There will be some challenges ahead, as this may be a paradigm shift for the business network.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>If replacing an existing system, consider running the blockchain-based solution as a shadow chain to mitigate risk. By this we mean, during the pilot phase, run the new platform alongside the legacy system. Ideally, you would pass real production data to the new blockchain-based system to test and validate it, while continuing to rely on the legacy system for this phase of the project. Only after thorough testing has been completed and the new system has been proven should you switch from the legacy system to the new.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Although blockchain is likely to be a core foundational part of the solution, it probably won’t be the majority. The blockchain network will still integrate with other external systems, providing additional functions such as off-chain data storage, identity access management, Application Programming Interface (API) management and presentation layers, and so on.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/us-en/signup?formid=urx-37934&amp;cm_mmc=Affiliate_OReilly-_-Developer_IBM+Developer-_-WW_WW-_-OReilly+Getting+Started+Enterprise+Blockchain+Ebook_ov70510&amp;cm_mmca1=000019RS&amp;cm_mmca2=10004805\">Read the full free ebook here</a>.</em></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><em>This post is a collaboration between O\\'Reilly and IBM. <a href=\"http://www.oreilly.com/about/editorial_independence.html\">See our statement of editorial independence</a>.</em></p>\\r\\n<p>Continue reading <a href=\\'https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/blockchain-solutions-in-enterprise\\'>Blockchain solutions in enterprise.</a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/w-Wv_GFFmpw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>'}],\n",

A recent <a href=\"https://www.wipo.int/publications/en/details.jsp?id=4386\">report</a> from the World Intellectual Patent Office (WIPO) found that together these three areas accounted for a majority of patents related to AI: computer vision (49% of all patents), natural language processing (NLP) (14%), and speech (13%).</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-31Vik\"><img alt=\"WIPO AI patent applications\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Figure1-997a9d41f2388998070f228223adec9a.png\"><figcaption><span class=\"label\">Figure 1. </span>A <a href=\"https://www.wipo.int/publications/en/details.jsp?id=4386\">2019 WIPO Study</a> shows patent publications in a few key areas. Image by Ben Lorica.</figcaption></figure>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Companies are awash with unstructured and semi-structured text, and many organizations already have some experience with NLP and text analytics. While fewer companies have infrastructure for collecting and storing images or video, computer vision is an area that many companies are beginning to explore. The rise of deep learning and other techniques have led to startups commercializing computer vision applications in security and compliance, media and advertising, and <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/unleashing-the-potential-of-reinforcement-learning?twitter=@bigdata\">content creation</a>.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Companies are also exploring speech and voice applications. Recent progress in natural language and <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/deep-learning-revolutionizes-conversational-ai\">speech models have increased accuracy</a> and opened up new applications. Contact centers, sales and customer support, and personal assistants lead the way as far as enterprise speech applications. Voice search, smart speakers, and digital assistants are increasingly prevalent on the consumer side. While far from perfect, the current generation of speech and voice applications work well enough to drive an explosion in voice applications. An early sign of the potential of speech technologies is the growth of <a href=\"https://econsultancy.com/the-future-of-voice-search-2020-and-beyond/\">voice-driven searches</a>: Comscore <a href=\"https://www.comscore.com/Insights/Presentations-and-Whitepapers/2017/The-Future-of-Voice-From-Smartphones-to-Smart-Speakers-to-Smart-Homes\">estimates</a> that by 2020 about half of all online searches will use voice; <a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en/marketing/insights/articles/gartner-top-5-marketing-predictions-for-2018\">Gartner recommends</a> that companies redesign their websites to support both visual and voice search. Additionally, <a href=\"https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/canalys-global-smart-speaker-installed-base-to-top-200-million-by-end-of-2019\">smart speakers are projected</a> to grow by more than 82% from 2018 to 2019, and by the end of the year, the installed base for such devices will exceed 200 million.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-RlWiz\"><img alt=\"WIPO AI patent applications\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Figure2-2-c87206571cd2004c284a5aec88d3861a.png\"><figcaption><span class=\"label\">Figure 2. </span>Types of voice interactions. Image source: Yishay Carmiel and Ben Lorica.</figcaption></figure>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Audio content is also exploding, and this new content will need to be searched, mined, and unlocked using speech technologies. For example, according to a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/06/business/media/podcast-growth.html\">recent <em>New York Times</em> article</a>, in the US, “nearly one out of three people listen to at least one podcast every month.” The growth in podcasts isn\\'t limited to the US: podcasts are growing in other parts of the world, <a href=\"https://supchina.com/podcast/learning-to-listen-chinas-billion-dollar-podcast-industry/\">including China</a>.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Voice and conversational applications can be challenging</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Unlike text and NLP, or computer vision, where one can pull together simple applications, voice applications—that venture beyond simple voice commands—remain challenging for many organizations. Spoken language tends to be “noisier” than written text. For example, having read many <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/topics/oreilly-data-show-podcast\">podcast</a> transcripts, we can attest that transcripts from spoken conversations still require a lot of editing. Even if you have access to the best <em>transcription</em> (speech-to-text) technology available, you often end up with a document with sentences that contain pauses, fillers, restarts, interjections (in the case of conversations), and ungrammatical constructs. The transcript may also contain passages that need to be refined due to the possibility that someone is “thinking out loud” or had trouble articulating or formulating specific points. Also, the resulting transcript may not be properly punctuated or capitalized in the right places. Thus, in many applications, post-processing of transcripts will require human editors.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In computer vision (and <a href=\"https://thegradient.pub/nlp-imagenet/\">now in NLP</a>), we are at a stage where data has become at least as important as algorithms. Specifically, pre-trained models have achieved the state-of-the art in several tasks in computer vision and NLP. What about for speech? There are a few reasons why a “one size fits all” speech model hasn’t materialized:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>There are a variety of acoustic environments and background noises: indoor or outdoor, in a car, in a warehouse, or in a home, etc.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Multiple languages (English, Spanish, Mandarin, etc.) may need to be supported, particularly in <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p07gyw04\">situations where speakers use</a> (or mix and match) several languages in the course of conversations.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>The type of application (search, personal assistant, etc.) impacts dialog flow and vocabulary.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Depending on the level of sophistication of an application, language models and vocabulary will need to be tuned for specific domains and topics. This is also <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/lessons-learned-building-natural-language-processing-systems-in-health-care\">true for text and natural language applications</a>.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Building voice applications</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Challenges notwithstanding, as we noted: there is already considerable excitement surrounding speech technologies and voice applications.

A recent <a href=\"https://www.wipo.int/publications/en/details.jsp?id=4386\">report</a> from the World Intellectual Patent Office (WIPO) found that together these three areas accounted for a majority of patents related to AI: computer vision (49% of all patents), natural language processing (NLP) (14%), and speech (13%).</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-31Vik\"><img alt=\"WIPO AI patent applications\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Figure1-997a9d41f2388998070f228223adec9a.png\"><figcaption><span class=\"label\">Figure 1. </span>A <a href=\"https://www.wipo.int/publications/en/details.jsp?id=4386\">2019 WIPO Study</a> shows patent publications in a few key areas. Image by Ben Lorica.</figcaption></figure>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Companies are awash with unstructured and semi-structured text, and many organizations already have some experience with NLP and text analytics. While fewer companies have infrastructure for collecting and storing images or video, computer vision is an area that many companies are beginning to explore. The rise of deep learning and other techniques have led to startups commercializing computer vision applications in security and compliance, media and advertising, and <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/unleashing-the-potential-of-reinforcement-learning?twitter=@bigdata\">content creation</a>.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Companies are also exploring speech and voice applications. Recent progress in natural language and <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/deep-learning-revolutionizes-conversational-ai\">speech models have increased accuracy</a> and opened up new applications. Contact centers, sales and customer support, and personal assistants lead the way as far as enterprise speech applications. Voice search, smart speakers, and digital assistants are increasingly prevalent on the consumer side. While far from perfect, the current generation of speech and voice applications work well enough to drive an explosion in voice applications. An early sign of the potential of speech technologies is the growth of <a href=\"https://econsultancy.com/the-future-of-voice-search-2020-and-beyond/\">voice-driven searches</a>: Comscore <a href=\"https://www.comscore.com/Insights/Presentations-and-Whitepapers/2017/The-Future-of-Voice-From-Smartphones-to-Smart-Speakers-to-Smart-Homes\">estimates</a> that by 2020 about half of all online searches will use voice; <a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en/marketing/insights/articles/gartner-top-5-marketing-predictions-for-2018\">Gartner recommends</a> that companies redesign their websites to support both visual and voice search. Additionally, <a href=\"https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/canalys-global-smart-speaker-installed-base-to-top-200-million-by-end-of-2019\">smart speakers are projected</a> to grow by more than 82% from 2018 to 2019, and by the end of the year, the installed base for such devices will exceed 200 million.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-RlWiz\"><img alt=\"WIPO AI patent applications\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Figure2-2-c87206571cd2004c284a5aec88d3861a.png\"><figcaption><span class=\"label\">Figure 2. </span>Types of voice interactions. Image source: Yishay Carmiel and Ben Lorica.</figcaption></figure>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Audio content is also exploding, and this new content will need to be searched, mined, and unlocked using speech technologies. For example, according to a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/06/business/media/podcast-growth.html\">recent <em>New York Times</em> article</a>, in the US, “nearly one out of three people listen to at least one podcast every month.” The growth in podcasts isn\\'t limited to the US: podcasts are growing in other parts of the world, <a href=\"https://supchina.com/podcast/learning-to-listen-chinas-billion-dollar-podcast-industry/\">including China</a>.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Voice and conversational applications can be challenging</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Unlike text and NLP, or computer vision, where one can pull together simple applications, voice applications—that venture beyond simple voice commands—remain challenging for many organizations. Spoken language tends to be “noisier” than written text. For example, having read many <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/topics/oreilly-data-show-podcast\">podcast</a> transcripts, we can attest that transcripts from spoken conversations still require a lot of editing. Even if you have access to the best <em>transcription</em> (speech-to-text) technology available, you often end up with a document with sentences that contain pauses, fillers, restarts, interjections (in the case of conversations), and ungrammatical constructs. The transcript may also contain passages that need to be refined due to the possibility that someone is “thinking out loud” or had trouble articulating or formulating specific points. Also, the resulting transcript may not be properly punctuated or capitalized in the right places. Thus, in many applications, post-processing of transcripts will require human editors.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In computer vision (and <a href=\"https://thegradient.pub/nlp-imagenet/\">now in NLP</a>), we are at a stage where data has become at least as important as algorithms. Specifically, pre-trained models have achieved the state-of-the art in several tasks in computer vision and NLP. What about for speech? There are a few reasons why a “one size fits all” speech model hasn’t materialized:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>There are a variety of acoustic environments and background noises: indoor or outdoor, in a car, in a warehouse, or in a home, etc.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Multiple languages (English, Spanish, Mandarin, etc.) may need to be supported, particularly in <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p07gyw04\">situations where speakers use</a> (or mix and match) several languages in the course of conversations.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>The type of application (search, personal assistant, etc.) impacts dialog flow and vocabulary.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Depending on the level of sophistication of an application, language models and vocabulary will need to be tuned for specific domains and topics. This is also <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/lessons-learned-building-natural-language-processing-systems-in-health-care\">true for text and natural language applications</a>.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Building voice applications</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Challenges notwithstanding, as we noted: there is already considerable excitement surrounding speech technologies and voice applications. We haven’t reached the stage where a general-purpose solution can be used to power a wide variety of voice applications, nor do we have voice-enabled <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/the-next-generation-of-ai-assistants-in-enterprise\">intelligent assistants</a> that can handle multiple domains.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>There are, however, good building blocks from which one can assemble interesting voice applications.

About half indicated they used TensorFlow or scikit-learn, and a third reported they were using PyTorch or Keras.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I recently attended an interesting <a href=\"https://rise.cs.berkeley.edu/\">RISELab</a> presentation delivered by <a href=\"https://www.carolemieux.com/\">Caroline Lemieux</a> describing recent work on <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/riselabs-autopandas-hints-at-automation-tech-that-will-change-the-nature-of-software-development\">AutoPandas and automation tools that rely on program synthesis</a>. In the course of her presentation, Lemieux reviewed usage statistics they had gathered on different deep learning frameworks and data science libraries. She kindly shared some of that data with me, which I used to draw this chart:</p>\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-6YOix\"><img alt=\"statistics on deep learning frameworks and data science libraries\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/image1-e18a246da831903928949a96696ffb38.png\"><figcaption><span class=\"label\">Figure 1. </span>Number of papers posted on <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/\">arXiv.org</a> that mention each framework. Source: Data from <a href=\"https://rise.cs.berkeley.edu/\">RISELab</a> and graphic by Ben Lorica.</figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n<p>The numbers are based on simple full-text searches of papers posted on the popular e-print service <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/\">arXiv.org</a>. Specifically, they reflect the number of papers which <i>mention</i> (in a full-text search) each of the frameworks. Using this metric, the two most popular deep learning frameworks among researchers are TensorFlow and PyTorch. From January to the end of June 2019, about 1,800 papers mentioned TensorFlow and a comparable number mentioned PyTorch.

About half indicated they used TensorFlow or scikit-learn, and a third reported they were using PyTorch or Keras.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I recently attended an interesting <a href=\"https://rise.cs.berkeley.edu/\">RISELab</a> presentation delivered by <a href=\"https://www.carolemieux.com/\">Caroline Lemieux</a> describing recent work on <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/riselabs-autopandas-hints-at-automation-tech-that-will-change-the-nature-of-software-development\">AutoPandas and automation tools that rely on program synthesis</a>. In the course of her presentation, Lemieux reviewed usage statistics they had gathered on different deep learning frameworks and data science libraries. She kindly shared some of that data with me, which I used to draw this chart:</p>\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-6YOix\"><img alt=\"statistics on deep learning frameworks and data science libraries\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/image1-e18a246da831903928949a96696ffb38.png\"><figcaption><span class=\"label\">Figure 1. </span>Number of papers posted on <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/\">arXiv.org</a> that mention each framework.

Specifically, they reflect the number of papers which <i>mention</i> (in a full-text search) each of the frameworks. Using this metric, the two most popular deep learning frameworks among researchers are TensorFlow and PyTorch. From January to the end of June 2019, about 1,800 papers mentioned TensorFlow and a comparable number mentioned PyTorch. Most notably, interest in PyTorch among researchers is growing rapidly: it grew 194% year-over-year (Jan-Jun 2018 compared to Jan-Jun 2019).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>To the extent that researchers and teachers are harbingers and strongly influence what future professionals might use, look for PyTorch to also gain users among data scientists, developers, ML engineers, and companies.
